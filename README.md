# Solutions to HackerRank challenges
This repository is a collection of updated solutions to programming challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).

## SQL

I have used MYSQL for the solutions. There are almost always multiple solutions to the same problem. I have tried including alternate solutions whenever possible.
